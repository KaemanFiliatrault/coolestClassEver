<h1>Hello Mr Avacado Man!</h1>
  <p>
    I am a firm materialist, and as such I beleive that the sole thing that defines the person we are is the actions we commit.
    Therefore, my cause is to be able to define myself in a positive light, and to leave a positive impact on the society and 
    environment that I live in through action.
